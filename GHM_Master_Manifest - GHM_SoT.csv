the-olympians-zeus-8,"Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children.",Internal notes,"Hesiod, Homer, Apollodorus",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-axW9S4Ys90qUT0T-tfVD9Tl1JcPyaKUB-NQz7trUY/edit?usp=sharing
the-olympians-posiedon,"Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.","A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources, and examples vary based on the style guide (like APA, MLA, or Harvard).

the-olympians-ares,"Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, he represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of wedlock.",Internal notes,"Hesiod, Homer, Apollodorus",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-axW9S4Ys90qUT0T-tfVD9Tl1JcPyaKUB-NQz7trUY/edit?usp=sharing
the-olympians-hades,"Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.","A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources, and examples vary based on the style guide (like APA, MLA, or Harvard).

the-olympians-aphrodite,"Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.",Internal notes,"Hesiod, Homer, Apollodorus",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-axW9S4Ys90qUT0T-tfVD9Tl1JcPyaKUB-NQz7trUY/edit?usp=sharing
the-olympians-apollo,"Apollo is the Olympian god of light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.","A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources, and examples vary based on the style guide (like APA, MLA, or Harvard).

the-olympians-athena,"Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice.",Internal notes,"Hesiod, Homer, Apollodorus",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-axW9S4Ys90qUT0T-tfVD9Tl1JcPyaKUB-NQz7trUY/edit?usp=sharing
the-olympians-hera,"Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.","A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources, and examples vary based on the style guide (like APA, MLA, or Harvard).

the-olympians-hermes,"Hermes is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads, flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the lyre and stole Apollo’s cattle on the very first day of his life. Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between the living and the dead.",Internal notes,"Hesiod, Homer, Apollodorus",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-axW9S4Ys90qUT0T-tfVD9Tl1JcPyaKUB-NQz7trUY/edit?usp=sharing
the-olympians-artemis,"Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity; in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her twin brother Apollo. Artemis was very protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.","A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources, and examples vary based on the style guide (like APA, MLA, or Harvard).
